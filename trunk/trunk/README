Included in this package are the following files/functions:

Navigation
  abs_est           - Absolute position filter and estimation
  rov_abs_interface - Absolute position interface
  move_towards      - Function to move the Rovio towards a point

Helpers
  add_angle  - Add two angles
  subt_angle - Subtract two angles
  lkf        - Linear Kalman filter (used in filtering the position)
  rovio      - Rovio class definition

To calculate the estimated position of the Rovio, run abs_est at each timestep.
An interface is included so you can watch the filter in action. In MATLAB, run
rov_abs_interface to start the interface. For more detailed documentation, run
'help function-name-here' in the command window of MATLAB.
